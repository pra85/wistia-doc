### Events: Heatmap

You can get the heatmap for any event by constructing the following URL:

<code class="full_width">GET https://api.wistia.com/v1/stats/events/[event-key]/iframe.html?public_token=[public_token]</code>

Replace the `<event-key>` token with the event_key that indicates which
heatmap you would like to see. You can get the `<event-key>` value from
other parts of this API or from the Wistia player itself.

Make sure you also provide your account's `<public_token>` as a parameter. You
can find your `<public_token>` by clicking on **API** in your Account Settings.

This URL is meant to be used as the target of an iframe which can then be used
to render the heatmap within your own pages.

Here is an example heatmap embedded right into this page:

<iframe src="https://api.wistia.com/v1/stats/events/1355283144880f0.12204939918592572/iframe.html?public_token=p5j1mnpakv" height="70" width="100%"></iframe>

Here is the code that we used to embed the heatmap:

{% codeblock heatmap_example.html %}
<iframe src="https://api.wistia.com/v1/stats/events/1355283144880f0.12204939918592572/iframe.html?public_token=p5j1mnpakv" height="70" width="100%" style="border: solid 2px black;"></iframe>
{% endcodeblock %}
